0.1.1:
 * Added SpamAssassin 2.0+ field "X-Spam-Checker-Version"
 * Changed behaviour as follows:
   - Old (already present) "X-Spam" fields are passed to SpamAssassin again,
     now it is up to SpamAssassin to make sure its not being lied to by 
     Spammers. 
   - Only mail that was previously marked being no Spam will get modified.
     Reported Spam will remain unchanged.
