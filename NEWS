0.1.2:

 * Many portability fixes.  Should build on any *BSD, Linux, Solaris,
   or Tru64 box, with any milter-compatible sendmail, with any
   compiler.
 * Fixed the "250K deadlock" bug.
 * Subject and Content-Types headers are only replaced if they changed. 
   This makes /var/log/maillog a bit cleaner for servers that get mail
   that has already been run through SpamAssassin.  The mail is still
   checked, so you can't bypass anything by adding SA headers.
 * Added SpamAssassin field "X-Spam-Level".
 * Added a manpage.
 * Added RedHat spec files.
 * -f option forks the milter into the background.
 * -d debugging option.

0.1.1:
 * Added SpamAssassin 2.0+ field "X-Spam-Checker-Version"
 * Changed behaviour as follows:
   - Old (already present) "X-Spam" fields are passed to SpamAssassin again,
     now it is up to SpamAssassin to make sure its not being lied to by 
     Spammers. 
   - Only mail that was previously marked being no Spam will get modified.
     Reported Spam will remain unchanged.


0.1.0:

First release. What do you expect? :-)
