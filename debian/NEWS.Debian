spamass-milter (0.3.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * spamass-milter now has a (currently not available upstream) -I option
    which will allow authenticated senders to skip SA checks in outbound
    mail. As this option is not yet integrated in upstream, the actually
    command line option may change in the future. You Have Been Warned.
