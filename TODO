Clean up the reject/copy to spambox/deliver to recipient options:

	         R  C  P
	
	-r       Y  -  -
	none     N  Y  Y
	-b       N  Y  N
	default  N  N  Y
	-b null  N  N  N
	
	With the current flags there is no way to simply add the
	spambox to the list of recipients.  You can silently drop by
	using -b to redirect to a /dev/null sendmail alias.

Try and expand aliases before checking for -u usernames
